   </a>
   . A bug thanks for their support!
  </p>
  <p>
   We're busy organizing the 3rd edition of the hack days, here are the details:
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    When
   </b>
   : February 11 (Saturday)
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Schedule
   </b>
   : We'll meet at 10:30, have a very short presentation on who wants to work on what and start hacking. Around 18:30 (or whenever we decided we are ready) we'll do a show and tell of what we've built, have a drink and talk about whatever we want. We'll keep it short, sweet, intense and interesting.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Where
   </b>
   : It will take place at the uberVU HQ which is right across from the Dinamo Stadium.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    What
   </b>
   : The theme will be:
   <b>
    Making life easier
   </b>
   . We'll work on ingenious, fun and witty hacks that can make our daily life easier. Further below is a list of some of the ideas we find interesting and we could work on. You can come up with you own, of course.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    What you will get out of this
   </b>
   : You'll meet and talk with interesting people, you'll have the chance to hack together with some of the best developers and learn a tone of new things. We'll make the best projects known to the world and you'll get all the bragging rights for your project. We'll all gather together at the end of the day and decide who had the best idea and who had the best implementation. Also, remember...
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    It will be fun
   </b>
   : We will make sure there will be food, drinks, music and a great vibe.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    What you need to do
   </b>
   : You need to
   <b>
    bring your laptop
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    think of or pick an idea
   </b>
   you will hack at. And that's it! We work in teams on 2-3 people, it's more fun this way and you can get more done, so bring your friends or make new friends at the event and convince them that your idea is worth hacking at.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Hack ideas:
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   An IRC / Campfire / whatever bot that can act as a waiter in a restaurant and gather the food and drinks orders from a group of people, starting from a predefined menu, tell them back the orders and when the ordering is done, send it or save it in some format.  Build a simple bot that replies to Tweets learning from past Tweets from an account. We're assuming that most institutional Twitter accounts have some standardized replies upon which a simple machine learning algorithm would actually learn the patterns. Here we can give access to our API which can help with this. A plugin to put Gmail on steroids: think of having the possibility to do a Google search directly in Gmail and putting the results in the email you are writing. Or even better, to be able to open 2 email messages in the same window and copy and paste from each other. A micro blogging platform that limits the time you have to write a post. Think something like: blog in 60 seconds. Take a look at
   <a href="http://oneword.com/">
   </a>
   <a class="linkified" href="http://oneword.com/">
    http://oneword.com/
   </a>
   . If Twitter worked, why not this? Who has time to blog? Some sort of a music player that will look at what music videos (let's say Youtube) your friends are listening to on Twitter / Facebook and make a playlist of those songs and similar to those. Something similar to

   .
   <b>
    Have a better idea
   </b>
   ? Make a plan and come and show what you can do!
  </p>
  <p>
   And that's all you need to know,
   <b>
    sign up
   </b>
   and see you at the event!
