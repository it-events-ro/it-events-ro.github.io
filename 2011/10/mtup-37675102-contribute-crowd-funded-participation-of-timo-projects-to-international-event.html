<h2>Contribute: crowd-funded participation of TiMo projects to international event</h2>

   Hello all,
  </p>
  <p>
   During the last year or so, we jointly witnessed or participated to the building up of a really vibrant mobile development community in Timisoara.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are some notable facts and figures about group's achievements and evolution. Some of them are referring to locally developed mobile products or services. It is one of group's goal to promote them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Being member of a network of business incubators, Timisoara Software Business Incubator, the organization that initiated TiMo could do this as it has the opportunity to attend an event this November 7-8, in Chisinau, with an
   <b>
    <a href="http://files.meetup.com/1751984/AIECA2011%20agenda%20draft3.doc">
     agenda
    </a>
   </b>
   focused on incubation and mobile industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have the possibility to bring with us 2-3 people from Timisoara relevant startups involved in development of mobile apps. Our plan is to involve in this delegation two or three of the high-school geeks you've seen last week presenting
   <b>

   </b>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    In order to make this possible we need your help:
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>

    <b>
     We are appealing to your generosity for fundraising the (2-3) x 168 EUR (as of today) cost of Timisoara-Chisinau-Timisoara Carpatair flight tickets as we have obtained the organizers' support for covering the local costs of the startup people (accommodation, food, program) but they cannot take over for the transportation costs.
    </b>
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   We would appreciate whatever contribution you can bring from a
   <b>
    starting value of 5 EUR
   </b>
   . We definitely prefer the community approach of crowd-sourcing versus a solid, enterprise type of sponsorship but if your company is keen to sponsor we'll definitely accept and publicly recognize its contribution on group's page and on the various social media channels we could access.
  </p>
  <p>
   I am convinced that this experiment, if successful, will permit the establishment of a mechanism that will perpetuate the offer of community support for those finding themselves at the beginning of their entrepreneurial path, in order to position them in the right time and in the right place in order to meet relevant people that could help them to kick-start their projects.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    If you are ready to commit a certain amount please let us know by RSVP "Yes" and by inserting the value in a comment to this event. You may also ask through a comment for whatever explanations you feel necessary. During the next couple of days we'll put in place a PayPal payment tool.
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Thanks a lot and stay tuned for news about the forthcoming mobile related events we are preparing for you!
  </p>
  <p>
