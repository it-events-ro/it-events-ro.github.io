<h2>On the road – Story of a traveler from Chile</h2>
<p class="text-muted">duminică, 30 martie 2014</p>

PART 1: About traveling and doing what you want in life
PART 2: Cardiac Coherance Workshop

With Kavier Emilio Cisternas Najle

English teacher in Chile, who started traveling 14 months ago, trying to learn from the people (cultures), animals, and nature; a passionate (mostly about music) and curious person, who tries to train positive thinking all the time; not afraid of being ridiculous, willing to learn from any person, animal or situation.

”I think that what you want in the world has to start from your actions and the way you think.”

...............................................................................................

PART 1

Key points:
”What I was doing before the trip
How the idea of traveling started
Photos of the different cities and landscapes around the world
How I have supported economically this trip
The most exciting stories about this adventure
Show the different cultures
How this trip has taught me that we always have to be open to changes of plans
Adapting to different cultures is not always easy, it requires humility, innocence, respect, and love
The feeling of being a baby discovering new people and their things all over the world
The impossibility of saying when this trip is going to end
The importance of being in the places and don’t fall in the egos of a traveler, after all we all have a story to tell
About risks and doing what we love 
Sometimes being inside a society doesn’t allow us to see that we are the only ones that have to put limits in our lives. So realize that sometimes we are scared of losing our jobs in our cities, but if we don’t take risks in life, we are just passing by.”

PART 2

Cardiac Coherance = breathing technique which establishes a coherence in the hearth beats - simple, and portable everywhere.
You can do it almost in every place, and mostly gives you a feeling of peace and joy. For example, if you are waiting on a line in the bank, instead of being upset, you can actually be improving your day, and in the end your life quality. We are supposed to breathe in that way, but we forgot. When we are sleeping, we automatically breathe in that way, and babies also do it all the time. Using the belly and blowing it just like a balloon.

Benefits:
It reduces the stress
It helps to develop a better cognition and also memory
It releases endorphins (hormones of happiness) in your blood stream
It strengthens the lungs
It improves the immunologic system
It may be helpful for addictive behaviors, because it decreases anxiety
It's good for people that have depression
Can improve your athletic
It reduces aggressive behaviors
It is helpful with insomnia
Generates a better disposition to compassion

”I have practised this technique for years, so I think that experience is the best master. I have also studied this technique with my spiritual guide from Canada. I have taught this technique almost whenever I could, and also when I was an English teacher I taught this to the teachers at the schools I worked, but also to the children I was teaching.”
