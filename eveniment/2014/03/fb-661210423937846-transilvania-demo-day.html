<h2>Transilvania Demo Day</h2>
<p class="text-muted">miercuri, 19 martie 2014</p>

Transilvania Demo Day is a way through which we put creative teams, small medium enterprises, research departments and creative spin-offs from local companies in the spotlight.

Demo Day is the event we developed because the local creative and innovative community in Cluj needs a bigger publicity and recognition. There are more and more businesses that could have a faster and higher growth, if only more people knew about what they were doing, so we’re trying to make that happen.

A number of tech and innovative projects, that are doing something new and interesting in their industries, will talk about and make a demo of their products. These will be subject to the audience’s analysis and will get feedback from the mentors panel.

An important component of the audience is represented by business owners and investors, interested to engage in this type of projects. They could be determined by the presenters, through their pragmatic novelty, to invest in the projects and teams present on stage. 

Each team will have 3 minutes to give a short talk and a demo of their products, in order to get valuable feedback – as well as some tough questions – from our audience, who will be made up of other entrepreneurs, potential customers and investors, and the media.

With this approach Transilvania Demo Day is opening doors for the entrepreneurs, help them connect with a network of people who are interested in what they’re doing and give them insight into possible ways to improve their business or product. And, of course,  for the audience, it’s a great learning experience, and a great way to spark new ideas!

The event is open to: entrepreneurs, investors, creators, the media, and anyone interested in new and innovative things.

Now you just need to save the date in your agenda and register your project here: http://www.clujinnovationdays.com/demo-day/

The presentations will be followed by a comprehensive interaction and networking between founders and investors, companies and public authorities interested to develop further the innovative community of Transylvania.

The event is part of the Cluj Innovation Days (www.clujinnovationdays.com).
Being supported by the ClujIT Cluster and Cluj-Napoca City Hall, ClujHUB is the event creator .

Community partners: StartUp Weekend Cluj, www.startuptransilvania.ro & StepUp - Incubation Program, Crowfunding Platform Crestem Idei, Open Connect, Startup Lounge.
