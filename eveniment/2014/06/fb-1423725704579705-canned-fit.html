Canned Fit
Controlled coalition of the unpredictable. Circuits of simultanitiy. Canned Noises, tinned tunes and melodic distorsions. 

The sound artist Christine Schörkhuber works with a fragile yet powerfull setup consisting of self-built electronic analog interfaces, sonorous everyday commodities and her voice.

The performance is floating between subtle crunchy sounds, song fragments, noise-fields and penetrating drones.

C. Canned fit is an experimental, performative Music act. The sound sphere is created by hacked effect tools, fingermicrophons, voice, feedback and a trash orchestra of found sonorous footage. Motorized Cans vibrate in Tune, the sound of Materials like Cans, Tins, Metal parts, electronic trash, Paper, Wood, Water and Wind are modulated and amplified through open mics.
Christine Schörkhuber was educated in media and installation art and also works with sound installations. Therefore she has an object-orientated approach towards her music. She is searching for the specific sounds of the small things of everyday´s life and enforces their character by giving them a function and a shape, just like a sculpturer working on his material.
Situation, room resonance and soundsystem are not considered just as circumstance and necessity, but as instruments on their own.

C. Canned Fit has been performed at various international festivals, clubs and art spaces and was selected for the New Austrian Sound of Music Programme for 2014/15.

"At times aged metallic sounds fused with warm shades of wood, then turns into a surreal and powerful air and fire spiral that was the prelude to a stylized silhouette of female voice throwing cascades of reverb, while folding time and space in a frequency Set drowning in seas of subsonic notes." - Rodrigo Moncada, Quillota 

KALEIDOSCOPE INSIGHTS

"Kaleidoskop insights" is a audio-visual road-movie through the contemporary romanian culture scene created by Christine Schoerkhuber and Maria Hera.
People engaged in the cultural sector speak about their work, their ambitions, motivations and circumstances of production. Field recordings, soundscapes and music interactions interlude with narrative Interviews, spoken comments and visual finds.
The Feature portrays cultural organizations in different contexts. The aim of the project is, to show a variegated and vivid potpourri of different cultural institutions in Romania like Off-Spaces witch are the germ cell of the art of tomorrow, across archeological attestations of former times, hackerspaces, music clubs, performing art and dance institutes or festivals like Fan Fest at Rosia Montana.

Her artistic work concentrates on collage, installation and space intervention, photo and street art.
