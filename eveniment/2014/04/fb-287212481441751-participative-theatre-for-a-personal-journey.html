<h2>Participative Theatre for a Personal Journey</h2>
<p class="text-muted">duminică, 6 aprilie 2014</p>

Ce?

Participative Theatre is a way to involve people in an artistic process in which they can discover things about themselves, the group and their reality. It is about methods and techniques that enhance people to share their stories and get a deeper insight in what is actually moving them.

It is not theatre in a common way, with a stage etc. But it is a kind of theatre that is FOR the people, and WITH the people. The path is much more important than the final result. The group with its needs and topics, is the main character in the whole experience. This process can encourage participants to find out more about themselves. Keep this secret to yourself and take it back home, or share it with the others and express together what bonds you all.Do not expect to become an actor/actress after this workshop, but allow your own actor/actress (mask) to once fall off and discover what lies behind. This can happen only for yourself, or for others to show.
Participative Theatre allows people to empower themselves and to share stories, actions and visions.

1st session:
Exploration of the Self (knowing, accepting, expressing, changing)
We will offer playful and artistic tools that will allow you to get an insight of who you are.
In the last third of the session we will discover the bond between Personal Stories and Social Society, which we form at that very moment.

2nd session:
Empowerment - Taking responsibility for your own life.
Finding a way of sharing our story and stories as a group.

This workshop enables participants (you) to explore. To explore what is within yourself, to explore who you are and who you might want to become. It can be the sharing of Personal Stories that make us understand that we are not the only ones, living it. Having the same issues, problems, joys, experiences, etc. makes Personal Stories become Social Stories. Following this thought, it means discovering yourself as a Social Subject within a wider Social Society, doesn' t just allow you to understand that you are one among many having the same "problems", but also it means that changing own behaviors and habits as part of the whole, allows social issues to change and transform.

What this Workshop is NOT about:
-This workshop will NOT enhance you to change yourself in any way. We simply provide methods, that allow you to discover your social self.
-It is NOT about sharing any personal issues. Everything we share will be symbolic. And everything you want to share with us is welcome too.

What this Workshop IS about:
-It will be a journey to what moves you from inside.
-It will give us the chance to discover and to work on ourselves, and also on what connects us within that as a Social Bonding.
-Our goal will be to create something together. Something that moves us all, something that connects us, something to discover together as part of a Social Society.
-And still it allows you your personal private journey that is left to your own discovery.

Come to both workshops this weekend, if you can and want! You will also be welcomed if you make it to only one of them.

Bring food or something to share with the whole group. If you have pillows, blankets and similar, bring them, so we can sit on something cozy!

We are happy to welcome you for a weekend with creative deeper insights, together.

Love and sunlight,
    Elisa and Pia



Cu cine?
Pia Brodtrager (din Austria)- I have been studying Theatre and Global Development, MA in Leeds / United Kingdom in 2012. Moreover, I have been trained in Theatre of the Oppressed since 2010 (in Kenya (www.apt.org), Romania, United Kingdom, Italia, Serbia, and Austria). I completed my internship with  Move This World (Peace Education through the Arts of Movement) in 2013 in Vienna. Throughout I have been focusing on working with youth with and without disabilities, in Serbia, Kenya, Austria and the UK (Mind The Gap / Bradford). Besides Theatre for Social Change with youngsters and young adults, I have been working with the organisation Theatre of the Oppressed Vienna (TDU Wien) and Amnesty International, where we worked on street theatre and arts for political and social messages. At the moment I am doing my EVS (European Voluntary Service) with incubator107 in Romania.

Elisa Sarchi (din Italia)– I’ve been working in social field since 2006, especially using theatre and non formal techniques (www.teatrocalypso.it) I worked in schools, communities, for youngsters and elderly people, prisons, educational centers. My approach is strongly symbolic: I like to build performance and theatre actions starting from groups creativity and then using texts and materials. Beside my social theatre training school, I attended different workshops and trainings about specific techniques: puppet theatre, creative writings, theatre and performance. Elisa is presently doing her EVS (European Voluntary Service) with incubator107 in Romania, Youth in Action [Tineret în Acțiune].
