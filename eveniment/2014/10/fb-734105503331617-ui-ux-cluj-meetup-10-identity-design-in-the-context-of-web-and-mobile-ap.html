<h2>UI/UX Cluj Meetup #10 - Identity Design in the context of web and mobile apps + Evolso App Testing</h2>
<p class="text-muted">marți, 14 octombrie 2014</p>

Hi there!

At our next meetup, Andrei will talk about Identity Design in the context of web and mobile apps. When thinking of business identity, we also think of the logo and brand of a business.

The logo, we all know how one looks like. It is the mascot, the trademark, it is an essential element that triggers the feelings of the consumers, it is the central point of a brand, through which clients identify the company. Identity is all the parts and elements in which you use the logo. When thinking of building a business identity, you think of how to strategically and consistently apply your defined business image, such as to develop and solve the branding puzzle.

Andrei Pastuhov is brand designer and the co-founder of Bloom Studio – Branding & Design. He has been working in the design and communication industry for 8 years, on both business and cultural projects. He sees design as process of mediation between a product or company and the final user and he’s been trying to develop a sound relation between these two in his projects. You have seen his work at TIFF, Colours of Cluj Festival, Of Snail and Men and many other corporate projects. More of his work on www.bloomstudio.ro.

After the identity design session with Andrei, we shall pass onto the hands-on part of our meetup with Alin from Evolso and we'll do some app user testing. More on this, on Tuesday.
