<h2>Digital Marketing Community Launch</h2>
<p class="text-muted">miercuri, 22 octombrie 2014</p>

Digital Marketing has been around, as a term, since the 1990's. Along the years and decades, it grew more and more sophisticated, and it's been rapidly expanding since 2010. Nowadays, it rarely happens that a marketing campaign does not focus on the digital aspect.   
Digital, as you might have already intuively thought by now, refers to approaching digital means of communication/ platforms: tablets, smartphones, social media etc. A clear distinction from the traditional marketing ways, can be seen when speaking of analytics and what they represent: real-time response and information from the market, from your users/clients. And this, this is priceless and it is a dream come true.  

Here at ClujHUB, we've been long waiting for this moment and for the launch of this brand new community: a community dedicated to marketers who want to know more about how they can excel at their job in the digital world. We propose monthly gatherings, dedicated to marketing specialists and marketing enthusiasts with the purpose of sharing knowledge, best practices and keeping up with the latest trends. Our intent is to bring marketing people close together and encourage people to learn from one another. There is a lot of talent in Cluj, there are a lot of creative people and they need to meet! 

We are proud to present our first meeting, our first speakers and the topics that they are going to present. In this initiative, Ciprian Soleriu and Robert Katai are the first to join us!

-----------------------------------------

You can join the community and register for the event here: http://www.meetup.com/DigitalMarketingCluj/events/213782162/

-----------------------------------------

Ciprian will have a talk on how to maximize conversions by captivating & monetizing your visitor's attention. He is a co-founder and business developer at Brain Art - agency specialized in PR and advertising. Follow Ciprian on Conversion Academy - where he helps business owners learn how to sell and attract more clients with their website by using psychology and marketing strategies aimed at increasing online conversions.

Robert's talk will be focused on digital visual marketing, a new wave in the online area, that aims at transforming transactional relationships into emotional ones, as people tend to share what matters to them in pictures, rather than in words. He is a Brand Evangelist at BannerSnack and the founder of Instagramology - the first web platform about Instagram. He also organised several projects and events about Instagram and wrote an e-book about it. You can find more about his work on his blog, Markataing.com.
