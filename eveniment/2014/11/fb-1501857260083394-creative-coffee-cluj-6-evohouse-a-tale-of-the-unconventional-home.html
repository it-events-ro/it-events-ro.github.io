<h2>Creative Coffee Cluj #6 — EvoHouse, a tale of the unconventional home</h2>
<p class="text-muted">joi, 13 noiembrie 2014</p>

We all want comfort in our homes. That's the reason for which we call it a home in the first place. You talk about comfort when you're talking about furniture, about finishes, home decorations. This time we won't be discussing about home decorations, but about something more basic and vital: energy eficiency and thermic comfort. 
 
We will debate on those details which make our home a warm nest, protected against outside elements, may it be summer or winter.

Probably, by now, everyone has heard of the passive house concept, but maybe, this concept is not clear enough. Still, it's a fact that the concept refers to a way of making life better by building an energy eficient house. But what does this mean exactly?

Marius and Bela will tell us what a passive house is.

•  Marius Soflete is a creative engineer, as the brand he's built around his career states. As a child he had a passion in plane modelling. Afterwards he also build small house models. From this point his fascination with constructions started, fact that led to his University choice as well. Once a student in the constructions field, he understood that the future need to be sustatinable, that the constructions industry need to be sustainable as well. This is how he began to be interested in green, energy eficient buildings. Chief coordinator of the Evohouse construction site, the only passive house in Cluj-Napoca, Marius will show in detail what a passive house is all about. He will talk about: Passivhouse Institut (Darmstad) standards of accreditation, new technologies which are used for this type of building and new types of insulation (wood fiber).

• Bela Barabas is the beneficiary of the passive house in Cluj-Napoca. The initiative and research on the building technology belong to Bela. He started documenting this project about 4 years ago. Thus, he gradually understood what a passive house means and what it involves in terms of investment and resources.

The event is dedicated to people interested in undertanding this technology as a user, as a future beneficiary and to engineers alike. The details presented won't be too technical, as to become unappealing to the eye of a non-engineer, but we promise to tickle the imagination of professionals as well.
