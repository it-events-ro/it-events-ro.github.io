<h2>Startup Lounge #8: Insane. Blazing. Cocky. Or how hardware startups make it.</h2>
<p class="text-muted">luni, 17 noiembrie 2014</p>

More hardware startups are driven into the market. Every year more capital is being attracted in this area as well. One would say, it is therefore a good time to start thinking about setting up a hardware startup. 

We won't say that it's easy or that it's cheap. Usually hardware startups come with a higher cost than just setting up the website and the application. A hardware startup needs more that just the team who is willing to invest their time resources in the idea and partners who back you up with word-of-mouth, promotion and know-how transfer.  
Although, not long ago, hardware startups used to be seen only at the margin of the startup ecosystem, nowadays they are more visbile. Aligned with the makers movement, hardware manufacturing is becoming more accesible. Why? Because more people understand how things work, more people are exposed to more info with each passing day and more people can meet those who have already went out there on the market, with a product - designed and implemented by them. 

Apart from the elements mentioned above, it is important to take into consideration the big enterprises, the multinationals that have reached out to the bright minds in the startup ecosystem and offered them a helping hand. How? By giving, for no cost whatsoever, hardware to help the startup build their protoype and by offering man power for hands-on work and research. 
This is our proposal for the startup community in Cluj. 
You're thinking of a hardware startup and you'd need help in finding the right hardware to build your prototype on? This is it! This is the moment! 

One company present in Cluj, that is offering prototyping platforms for the local startups is National Instruments. They are bringing to the table their know-how, their hardware and their projects. Vlad Zileriu will give an insight on the company's projects in the fields of green engineering and medical solutions. 

The scope of the meeting is to match hardware needs with solutions that NI can offer. So if you are searching for hardware prototyping solutions, this should definitely be your stop. Mark the day in your calendar and tell us what your designing! 

This event is part of a series of events, designed to sustaining and improving the hardware startup scene in the region.
