   In a tribute radio cast to Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein spoke - he said that the technology he had created, this technology is something that people still have to get used to. Referring to the light bulb.
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
   Early technology has brought to man that which made his life comfortable, his house warmer and his travels safer. When being an inventor back in the days, this meant for the creator to make something totally new, that people could not yet believe as being real or useful. Because they were accustomed with the thought that existence was rough and there was nothing that could be done to change this.
  </p>
  <p>
   But nowadays,
   <b>
    technological advancements
   </b>
   are of such a subtle nature, that they appear to be very familiar and very natural. Technology is very close to functioning as if it were a real person and interact, respond and solve problems as if it had a mind of its own. If back in the times it was man who needed to get used to new technology, now it is technology that needs to get used to man. And it is only a natural step in the
   <b>
    HMI (human-machine interaction) evolution
   </b>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   AI was very popular starting with the 1990s. Today
   <b>
    machine learning, speach recognition and computer vision
   </b>
   are fashionable technologies, because they represent the answer to the question: what can we do such that machines respond in as much a natural way as possible?
  </p>
  <p>
   Scientists, programers and companies throughout the world are fascinated by the endless possibilities that this technology brings and they are focused on exploring it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Such a company is
