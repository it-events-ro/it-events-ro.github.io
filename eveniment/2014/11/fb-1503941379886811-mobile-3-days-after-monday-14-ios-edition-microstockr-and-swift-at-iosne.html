<h2>Mobile (3 days after) Monday #14 - iOS Edition: Microstockr and Swift at iOSNeXT</h2>
<p class="text-muted">joi, 27 noiembrie 2014</p>

1. Microstockr - Mobile analytics for stock photography

Microstockr is co-founded by Marcel Pirosca and Paul Pirosca. They are both passionate photographers and contributors to large photo agencies, such as Shutterstock and iStock. Working with these two platforms for some time now, they realised that don't have a means of centralising info reagarding the photos they traded and income that they earned from both agencies. 

This is how the journey started and Microstockr was built. A tool that would help photographers have a better management of their online trading activity.

The presentation will contain the following: 
- mobile platforms and data processing (crawling) 
- data sync between iOS and Android by using Dropbox API 
- in App Purchases (subscriptions) 
- push Notifications (background fetch) -income/sales estimation methods


2. Swift - preview for iOS NeXT
At WWDC 2014, Apple announced Swift, a new programming language for iOS and OS X.  
In this session, Paul Ardeleanu will give a preview for his Swift workshop that will take place on 29th November, during the iOSNeXT event.

He will make a short review of Swift’s fundamental concepts: 
-built-in types and collections 
-optionals 
-closures 
-protocols.

You will also see how Swift improves on Objective-C in terms of type safety, readability and developer productivity.

Paul is an experienced iOS and web developer, trainer and mentor, specialised in complete software solutions, technical leadership and customer experience. He started programming back when Fortran was cool and is now using languages that have not yet been invented.
