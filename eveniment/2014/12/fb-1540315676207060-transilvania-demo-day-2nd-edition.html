<h2>Transilvania Demo Day #2nd edition</h2>
<p class="text-muted">luni, 15 decembrie 2014</p>

# Why:
We have a strong desire to help innovative and creative startups succeed. 

# How:  
We’re doing this by organizing a one-day event where startups have a pitch to attract feedback  from the mentors  panel and interest from investors present at the event. 

With this approach Transilvania Demo Day is opening doors for the entrepreneurs, help them connect with a network of people who are interested in what they’re doing and give them insights into possible ways of improving their business or product. And, of course, for the audience, it’s a great learning experience, and a great way to spark new ideas! 

# Who: 
Startup Transilvania has confirmed for the 2nd edition of the Demo Day for the opening speeches: 
- Peter Barta Angel Investor & Executive Director Fundatia Post Privatizare 
- András Kapy, CEO Axosuits, medtech startup that builds advanced exoskeleton, winners of the 10.000 $ prize at HTW 2014
- Bogdan Mugescu, Business Developer at Bucharest Stock Exchange
- Mentors & investors panel | confirmations ongoing 
- 15 startups pitching | registration still open

_______________________________________________


A way through which we put creative teams, small medium enterprises, research departments and creative spin-offs from local companies in the spotlight.

# When & where: 
15th of December at 5pm @ The Office, Cluj-Napoca

# This event is dedicated to: 

A number of tech and innovative projects, that are doing something new and interesting in their industries, will talk about and make a demo of their products. These will be subject to the audience’s analysis and will get feedback from the mentors panel. 

An important component of the audience is represented by business owners and investors, interested to engage in this type of projects. They could be determined by the presenters, through their pragmatic novelty, to invest in the projects and teams present on stage.

# Schedule: 
Each team will have 4 minutes to give a short talk and a demo of their products, in order to obtain the investors interest  – as well as some tough questions – from our audience, who will be made up of other entrepreneurs, potential customers, investors and the media.
