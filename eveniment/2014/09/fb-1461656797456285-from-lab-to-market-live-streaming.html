<h2>From Lab To Market - Live Streaming</h2>
<p class="text-muted">miercuri, 17 septembrie 2014</p>

What are the steps to bringing a scientific discovery to the market place? 

Timisoara Startup Hub partners with the US based GIST in order to make available to Timisoara interested people a new TechConnect panel discussion through live streaming from the Department of State in Washington DC.

Our fellow Ovidiu Bujorean, Dr. Jill S. Becker (Founder of Cambridge Nanotech, CXO of 02139 Inc.), and Dr. Michael Koeris (Co-founder and COO of Sample6 Technologies) will discuss what it takes to bring new products from laboratories to market. 

The group will also look at the difference in cultures from academia to business, the pros and cons of patenting and selection of the appropriate market for your goods. If you are on the market side looking to see how you can help scientists, or on the scientist side looking out towards bringing a new discovery to market, this program will help answer questions and offer suggestions from people who’ve been down that road. So bring your ideas, your experience, and your questions to engage in a deep discussion and network with like-minded innovators and entrepreneurs.

Dr. Jill S. Becker is a serial entrepreneur with multiple academic publications, U.S. patents, and entrepreneurship awards to her name. 

Most recently, she is the Founder and CXO of 02139 Inc., a strategy consulting firm focused on helping clients understand the cusp of new technologies and adopt new ways to deliver growth effectively. She was also the founder of Cambridge NanoTech, a highly profitable firm specializing in the delivery of multiple-application ultra-thin films created by Atomic Layer Deposition. For her leadership and ingenuity at Cambridge NanoTech, she won multiple awards, including the 2010 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year award. 

Jill holds a B.S. from the University of Toronto and completed her Ph.D in Chemistry at Harvard University.
