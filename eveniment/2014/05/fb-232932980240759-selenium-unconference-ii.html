<h2>Selenium Unconference II</h2>
<p class="text-muted">sâmbătă, 17 mai 2014</p>

The Unconference
Selenium Unconference is a volunteer-run, non-profit event organised by members of the community that aims to bring together users and developers to share ideas, socialize and share their expirience.
The Unconference aims to bring Selenium closer to the Cluj-Napoca community, presenting how it is used by the big players in the industry and how we as a team can contribute to the Selenium project as it is an open source project.
The second edition will continue our effort to build a confortable place to talk about Selenium both for the newcomers to this field and also for those working now for several years with it. After the presentations we encourage people to share issues/problems they've met while working with Selenium, underlining the unconference concept.
Selenium
Selenium is an open-source project for testing web-based applications in any web browser on any operating system on any device desktop or mobile.
The Organizers
If you have any questions about the conference, please contact with the organizers and someone will contact you!
