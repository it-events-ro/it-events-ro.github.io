<h2>UI/UX Cluj Meetup#8 - UI/UX Tools + Designer Wanted @ Cluj IT</h2>
<p class="text-muted">marți, 12 august 2014</p>

Hi guys,

In this meeting we’re going to approach the subject of UI/UX tools and not only.

Within a team, when thinking of what tools would be best to be used, your first questions would be:

o is there a tool that you are already using?
o are the team members happy with the solution you chose?
o what's our budget?
o how many projects do you plan on implementing?

Our discussion’s catalyzer is Horatiu from Skobbler and he will guide us through the process of creation while using tools such as: Jira, Balsamiq, Gliffy, Moqups and others. As Horatiu is specialized in product management (his team is dealing with all that Requirements, Usability, User Interface imply), he will also discuss about how a product comes to life and how a team can organize itself around a product, in order to make it be among the best on the market.

Following the tools session, Cristian from Cluj IT Cluster (specifically the Innovation Group) is going to have a short entry regarding a really cool project their developing, a product made in Cluj that the're going to launch soon and they're looking for a cool designer to join their team.

And last, but not least, we're going to have the guys and girls from Catwalk15 coming over. Catwalk15 if one of the hottest startups in Cluj at the moment. They've been working on their app for quite a while and now they're ready to launch. They will have a presentation on how they've dealt with their UI/UX challenges and how they've implemented user requirements.

You can register here: http://www.meetup.com/UXUICluj/events/177041412/.

See you on Tuesday, same place, same hour,

The Team
