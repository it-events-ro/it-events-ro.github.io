<h2>RGDA Meetup - Iasi</h2>

  <p>
   This month,
   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rgdassociation/">
    Romanian Game Developers Association - RGDA
   </a>
   is hosting a meetup in another important city for the game development industry - Iasi.
  </p>
  <p>
   There, we will be waiting for you, with 2 interesting topics:
  </p>
  <p>
   - Indie With a Day Job
  </p>
  <p>
   - Indie Game Life Cycle
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ionut.sima.370">
    Ionut Sima
   </a>
   - is the founder of
   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vsistudio/">
    Very Simple Idea Studios
   </a>
   and currently one half of this Bucharest based studio. He will talk about the challenges of being a game developer and have a day job, at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not everyone has the resources needed to pay himself or herself or a team, in order to create a game. Not everyone has the time or means to commit to this task full time. But that shouldn't really be a deterrent as long as you are dedicated: you can develop games from scratch and achieve success with them, but the road there will be very challenging.
  </p>
  <p>
   The presentation will cover the experience of the developers from Very Simple Idea Studios and what they learned while creating their debut game - Idle Civilization. They will share the ups and downs of what it means to start making a game with zero monetary investment, how to think about choosing what your game will be about, how to manage your time and willpower when you have a day job that has nothing to do with game development, how to deal with promotion, presentation and feedback, especially when your game really lacks in visuals and style, how to manage your community and get through all the hoops needed to publish your game and turn profitable so that you can actually fund your next projects.
  </p>

    Daniel Flamaropol
   </a>
   - Co-Founder of
   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TMEGames/">
    T-Me Games
   </a>
   , an indie studio from Bucharest, will talk about the Indie Game Life Cycle.
  </p>
  <p>
   A succint presentation about the steps, tiers and milestones in the life of an indie game. From the early sketch of an idea to finishing touches, we will identify the key decision-making areas, when to state that enough is enough, when to ask for feedback and, most importantly, what a finished game looks like.
  </p>
  <p>
   He will talk about feature bloating, exposing unfinished products to the public, fast iterating on game design ideas, community-driven decisions and best practices for implementing and guiding user feedback. He will also discuss useful tools for acquiring fan bases, as well as an in-depth analysis on how Steam Greenlight and Google Play work and how social media can make or break your game launch.
