<h2>Threat Profiling Workshop</h2>
<p class="text-muted">sâmbătă, 30 ianuarie 2016</p>

The target group of this workshop are: 

business executives, decision makers, security professionals, risk managers but also individuals who are interested to identify and prioritise the relevant threats to the environment being assessed, and to determine how they could manifest to cause harm to the organisation.

Workshop Summary:

There is and always will be a permanent race in cyber space between attackers and defenders. Unfortunately, at the moment attackers are one step ahead. In this race it is impossible to know and, finally, to beat the opponents without understanding their capabilities and attack methods. Hence, understanding threats is a vital element towards protecting organisation that needs to be in the focus of business leaders and information security professionals alike.

The concept of a threat is often misused, with many prominent organisations and frameworks still using the term threat when they mean either attack or vulnerability. A threat is defined as anything that is capable, by its action or inaction, of causing harm to the organisation by compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information asset.

Populating a threat landscape for the environment being assessed involves identifying potentially relevant threats through discussion with key stakeholders, and analysing available sources of threat intelligence. At the conclusion of the Threat Profiling exercise, the defined and agreed threat landscape, in-scope threat events and impacted information assets (inventory) should be documented by the business. 

For each threat, we will assess specific characteristics known as threat attributes. These attributes will be used to help model the behaviour of each threat, a process known as threat profiling.

“Know yourself, know the enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories”

***
The workshop will give attendees the understanding and the tools needed to:

1. Profile and prioritise all threats that are relevant to the organisation (environment) being assessed
2. Identify the potential ways that the highest priority threats could manifest to cause harm to the organisation

***
Steps:

1. Populate the threat landscape; What Threats could target our environment?
2. Profile Threats; What are the characteristics of the threats?
3. Produce a prioritised threat landscape; Which threats must we address?
4. Scope and map the threat events; Which threat events can a threat use?
5. Identify and map information asset(s) impacted by each threat event; Which assets are exposed to a Threat - Threat event(s)?
