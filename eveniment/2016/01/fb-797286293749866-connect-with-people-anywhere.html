<h2>Connect with people anywhere!</h2>
<p class="text-muted">duminică, 17 ianuarie 2016</p>

Ce ?
What would your life look like if you had the confidence and the skill to approach a stranger anywhere and at anytime? Do you think it’s possible to find a genuine connection with everybody that you meet?

What if I told you there was a way to meet as many as 10-15 new people in one day? Whether in Romania or abroad, in a café or a shopping mall or even on the street. I truly believe that we can connect with people anywhere.

Are you looking for a new girlfriend? A business partner? Or someone to help you lose weight? Then you probably need to make some new connections.

Come and join us for an afternoon workshop with UK based Ollie Trew as he reveals his secrets for building instant rapport and meeting all of the right people in your life. Ollie’s belief is that you never know who you are going to meet and what they will be prepared to do for you if they like you.

The workshop “How to meet people anywhere” will be held at the Incubator in Bucharest between 4-6pm on Sunday 17th January. Limited space available, arrive early to avoid disappointment.

·         What People will learn

Ollie will be showing you how to: 

-Become a conscious connector

-Connect with yourself, your dreams and your purpose 

-Connect with the energy that you need to achieve your dreams & goals

-Connect & meet all of the right people in your lives to bring your dreams to life (we really are the product of the people that we hang around with most)

& In the process you will also:

-Learn more about yourself and your strengths

-Build confidence and begin to overcome any fear of rejection 

-Be surrounded by an incredible group of peers who are also looking to meet all of the right people in their lives.

·         What they will do and with whom

There will be live role plays, interactive learning and sharing, connection games and much more. These 2 hours could make a radical difference to your life and the dreams and goals that you want to achieve. You could be sitting next to the CEO of Vodafone on a park bench, he/she may even offer you a job—anything is possible, but you won't know unless you try to connect.

I can't wait to see you all there. If you know anyone that might be interested then please don’t hesitate to spread the word ;)
