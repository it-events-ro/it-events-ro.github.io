<h2>Nomad life &amp; Clown workshop. Philosphy, techniques and emotions</h2>
<p class="text-muted">sâmbătă, 9 ianuarie 2016</p>

Hello little clowns,
I'm a clown teacher. I'd be glad tu run a clown workshop for free in Bucharest.
· Content: clown philosophies, techniques and emotions.
- 16:00h. - 17:30h. Talks: Nomad life. 
- 17:30h. - 20:30h. Clown workshop: Phylosophies, techniques and emotions.

You must know: 
- Spectators aren't allowed, just only participants. 
- Not limit age (14yo, 30yo, 80yo...). But the games we'll play aren't created to teach children (all games are innocent, of course, but the technique to teach children is different). But it's not a problem if you come with your children. 
- I will speak in English. 
- Disabilities aren't a problem. 
- If you're sad, lonely or you have a cronic illness, come in! You'll feel better. Clown workshops are therapeutic. 
- You won't do nothing that you didn't want. 
- You won't feel stupid (to be a clown is a very serious thing). 
- Try to bring a RED nose. If you don't have or you don't find a shop, you can create it (red cap from a soda drink, two holes and an elastic string). 
- I don't sell red noses or another thing.

The clown worshop is too short, only 3 hours, so, we won't have a break if it's not necessary. We will start at 17:30h. So, if you aren't interested in the meeting, please, arrive a little bit earlier than 17:30h.

The Incubator107 is supported by donations. So, if you want, you can donate or isn't. Here more information in English: http://bucuresti.incubator107.com/articles/1?locale=en

I said and insisted on I won't take a part of the donations. Couchsurfing philosophy.

I hope you can participate because it will be very funny.

Red Noses and love! 
:o)

Cu cine?
Conference: 
Ray (Canary Islands) is a nomad that lives in a camper van since 2011. He visited 42 countries and he met new awesome friends. He has a lot of interesting stories to tell to his future grandchildren. He finances his trip working as a street performer. He's sure that you can pursue your dream to travel around the world because he can and he's not different to you. He changes a lot in a better way. He accepted himself and the death. He's in harmony with the Earth and all living beings. He discovered the meaning of the life, the secret of the happiness, what's love... If you'd like to know how he is living a great life because you want to follow your own dreams, come to the meeting and ask all questions that you want.

Clown workshop: 
Ray was born by first time in Canary Islands when he was younger than one year old. After he discovered his inside clown, he born every day. Ray won two clown awards and he's teaching clown workshop around Europe (Austria, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, Spain,...) because he loves to discover the inside clown of the people, your clown.
