  </p>
  <p>
   the formal part, consisting of presentations delivery and formal discussions will take place in one of the spaces adjacent to the City Business Center Building C's lobby (that will be clearly indicated locally). This will also include three 3 minutes presentation by designers that have developed a wide set of logo proposals for out group. the informal part, with networking value and informal, small group discussions will take place at 700 Coffee &amp; Lounge, both indoors and on terrace (if the weather permits). During this part, a voting process will take place to designate the most popular of the proposed logos.
  </p>
  <p>
   The program of this edition will include the following entries:

   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Radu will expose the conclusions of a working meeting that took place April 27, when different issues regarding the future activities within the group were discussed. Other points to be presented will refer to opportunities in the mobile development field.

    2. Developing mobile apps on iOS vs Android -

     Radu Fericean
    </a>
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   As a teaching assistant in "Politehnica" University of Timisoara, Radu developed a mobile application for the
   <a href="http://icsm2010.upt.ro/">
    ICSM 2010
   </a>
   event organized in Timisoara. As the app development for both iOS and Android platforms was done simultaneously, the process was an excellent opportunity for an experienced desktop and web programmer to take a first contact with the field. Radu will share his mobile app beginner developer impressions in a comparative way, referring to development concept, programming languages, IDEs, interface builders, simulators, SDK versions, working with the mobile devices and the applications deployment. Radu promises to give an interesting and interactive presentation. Those who are "wild fans" of one or the other of the platforms are invited to "sharpen their knives" for a (moderated) discussion following the presentation.
