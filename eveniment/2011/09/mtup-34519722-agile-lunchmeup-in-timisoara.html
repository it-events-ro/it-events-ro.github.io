<h2>Agile LunchMeUp in Timisoara</h2>
<p class="text-muted">vineri, 23 septembrie 2011</p>

  <p>
   A small group of tech guys from Timisoara invites you to join a new initiative aiming to foster the existing, various tech communities and, why not, to ignite the creation of new ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   Don’t expect a complex concept asking you to commit lots of time, preparation and implementation efforts in order to attend gatherings of tens or hundreds of experts and profanes. Not at all!
  </p>
  <p>
   You just have to examine your technology and business interests and find around small groups that are meeting in the city, over the lunch, to combine this inevitable daily routine with insightful discussion on one of the themes you enlisted as your interests.
  </p>
  <p>
   We are speaking about groups of 4-6-8 participants, teamed around a probably not-round table, spending together 60 to 90 minutes, nobody leaving earlier than the desert and probably staying silent only while eating the courses. No rigid agenda, pivoting encouraged if consensus exists!
  </p>
  <p>
   Of course everybody is supposed to order a lunch (check on www.azilapranz.ro :) the offers) and pay at least for his own meal! It starts small, with potentially 4 micro lunch events this week, one of which is Agile-centered:
  </p>
  <p>
   1. Wordpress Lunch, Thursday, September 22nd, 1PM, in La Maria Restaurant, hosted by Cristian Antohe (@sareiodata). 8 places in total, 3 still available.
  </p>
  <p>
   2. Amazon Web Services Lunch, Friday, September 23rd, 1 PM, at Jarvis, hosted by Calin Brandabur (@cbrandabur). 8 places in total, 6 still available.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    3. Switching to Agile. Painlessly!, Friday September 23rd, 1 PM, in Aquarium Restaurant, hosted by Flavius Stef (@flaviusstef). 8 places in total, 6 still available.
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   4. Mobile Business: B2C vs B2B, monetizing, mobile payments, Friday September 23rd, 1 PM, in San Marzano Pizza &amp; Karaoke, hosted by Andrei Firoiu (@andreifiroiu). 6 places in total, 2 still available.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is the
   <a href="http://www.lunchmeup.com">
    Lunch Me Up
   </a>
   in Timisoara, a concept that encourages you to meet people sharing the same interests but also to become the next host of a themed lunch in our city.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    As the project is still in the proof of concept stage and it's not operated yet on its own web platform we are kindly asking you to also register your interest on LunchMeUp's Facebook page,
    <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/LunchMeUp/269179373103668?sk=events">
     here
    </a>
    !
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Please contact the host of the lunch you would like to attend in order to register and send us an e-mail if you would like “to lunch up” a small group on a specific theme during the next period.
  </p>
  <p>
   We’ll make sure your proposition is properly promoted in the local tech community!
