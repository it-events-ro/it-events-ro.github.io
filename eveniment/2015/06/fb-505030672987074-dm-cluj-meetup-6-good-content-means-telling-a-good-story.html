<h2>DM Cluj Meetup #6 - Good content means telling a good story</h2>
<p class="text-muted">marți, 9 iunie 2015</p>

Last minute announcement: because of a last minute issue she had, Alexandra will not be able to join us today. However, we will meet with Marian at 6.30 in order to find out how to use storytelling in the context of good content creation.

Often in marketing we get so caught up in tools, procedures and brand visuals that we forget about an important element at the core of any communication or sales activity: good content. And oftentimes, good content gets delivered via a story. A good story manages to inspire, to move people, to spark emotion. The art of storytelling is something any marketer should strive to learn. On Tuesday, we meet with Alexandra Craciun from Exquisite and Marian Hurducas from Necktie to talk about big stories and little stories, told on blogs, in images or in a short 140 character message.

• Agenda:

18.15 - 18.30 The community is gathering

18.30 - 19.10 Alexandra Craciun - How to use storytelling to communicate your brand

19.10 - 19.25 coffee break

19.25 - 20.05 Marian Hurducas - Social media, micro-content and storytelling

20.05 onwards - socializing :)


• About the speakers:
