<h2>Youth Innovation Week in Cluj-Napoca</h2>
<p class="text-muted">sâmbătă, 27 iunie 2015</p>

In Romania, and Cluj in particular, the startup environment has witnessed an important growth in the last few years. However, we might ask ourselves how does this growth compare to the rest of the Central & Eastern Europe or with Europe in general? Are we ahead or lagging behind? Is there more space for growth, will we have access to more resources, or only to more competition? If you're working on a startup or inteding to start one, we are sure you want to find this out.

This event is part of Youth Innovation Week organised by EYIF in cooperation with 5 of its European Hubs. This consists of 5 events in 5 European cities over the course of 5 days, as follows:  Warsaw, Cluj, London, Barcelona and Athens. The events are focusing on developments and trends in youth innovation relevant to the local ecosystem.

Thus, here in Cluj-Napoca, we are celebrating the Youth Innovation Week with an event in which experts, startup owners and succesful entrepreneurs will discuss the issue of Romanian startups in an international context. This event is organized by EYIF in collaboration with Cluj HUB and will take place on Saturday, 27 June, starting from 17.00, at The Office building.
