<h2>DM Cluj Meetup #3 - Blogs: How can they benefit your business or your growth?</h2>
<p class="text-muted">marți, 3 februarie 2015</p>

Dear Digital Marketers, 

Now that a new year has started, we plan on conducting these meetings on a monthly basis, with the same recurrence: the meetups will be held on the first Tuesday of each month. Having this in mind, please schedule/book the dates in your calendar. :)

This Tuesday we will have a handful of digital marketers who will share their knowledge with us. This meeting's topics are focused on blogs and the art of blogging: why, who, how, for what purpose. 

What are blogs used for? Are they just a freelancer's endeavor? Who would best benefit from having a blog? A SME, a multinational, is it something more related to the field of activity? Is it best suited for programmers, for copyrighters? Whould a blog be useful for artist or for sportsmen? Would a blog be useful for an awareness campaign, or a fund raising campaign? What do you think?

Well, if you're curious about all these things and a lot more other, you're especially invited.
