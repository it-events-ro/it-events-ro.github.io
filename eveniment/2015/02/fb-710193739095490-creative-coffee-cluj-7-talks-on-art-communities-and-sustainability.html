<h2>Creative Coffee Cluj #7 — Talks on art, communities and sustainability</h2>
<p class="text-muted">miercuri, 11 februarie 2015</p>

Come sit with us!

Creative Coffee is first and foremost a networking event 
to meet fellow creatives. We're starting 2015 with lots and lots of inspiration and we want to share this with you! 

Our proposal for this creative evening is to share thoughts with creatives who have not only found sustainable ways of creating and sharing their art, but they're also giving back to the communities to which they belong. 

• Cristina Pardanschi and Cornel Raileanu, founders of PERSONACT.ro, will join us and inspire us! 

What they do is quite unique and also oriented towards helping their kin. Have you heard of improvisational theater? Have you heard of people participanting at such events? What do you know about this? These are all questions that will be answered by our two guests. 

They have build their current activity on the years of experience they have had as professors and actors. And through their workshops, they've brought creativity back into people's lives and helped them cross over difficulties in communication while at home, while at their jobs, while relating to and interacting with their sorroundings. 

• Radu Salcudean, is co-founder of Ciorchin.ro and part of the team of Photo Romania Festival. One of Cluj's creative entrepreneurs, Radu is also dedicating part of his time towards giving back to the community, by supporting NGOs like Little People with photography services, photography trainings and his time as part of the organizing team. 

He is an innovator, as there are many gadgets he had to built himself, in order to finish photographic projects. A student in art directing, he returned to his lifelong passion - photography - obtaining a bachelor and masters in arts. Since then he has not stopped learning, as he afterwards started teaching. Read more about him on his personal blog here: http://www.fiveoclockphoto.ro/about/. 

Enjoy a cup of coffee with fellow creative entrepreneurs! 

Limited seating and tickets are required. Arrival is between 6:15 and 6:30.  

We can't wait to meet you all and cheer you on in 2015!
