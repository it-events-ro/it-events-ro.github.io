<h2>Tech Academy: Workshop #1 - Selenium Saturday</h2>
<p class="text-muted">sâmbătă, 28 februarie 2015</p>

Welcome to our Selenium Saturday event!

The purpose of this workshop is to teach you the basic skills needed to write your own automation test. We’re going to learn about Webdriver, CSS locators, Test runners and then we’re going to write webdriver tests.

FROM THE AGENDA:
1. Getting started with WebDriver and Web testing
2. Basic interactions with the browser using WebDriver
3. Upgrading our code into a reusable test
[..]
8. Using a base class
9. Reducing duplication with app objects
# Cick here: http://techacademy.ro/schedule/february-workshop-selenium-saturday/ to see the full agenda and speaker line-up.

SPEAKERS:

Mark Collins has now been tinkering with Selenium for over 7 years whilst working for various companies as a test consultant. He is the maintainer of the driver-binary-downloader-maven-plugin which enables mavenised selenium projects to download the external web driver binaries required to run tests. He is also a core contributor to the jmeter-maven-plugin, a tool that enables to run your JMeter tests as part of a maven project. Mark is currently working on a book that will teach people how to start mastering selenium.

Razvan Vuscan is a quality-oriented software tester proficient in thinking outside the box and from the client’s or the user’s perspective. He has 4 years of testing experience a. Currently working on projects for big names in the hotel industry, he is constantly looking for new ways of improving his code. He takes great care to write thorough, atomized tests, and has lately been trying to create a testing framework template based on Selenium and Java that can be re-used across web projects. He’s also started looking into Gatling for performance testing, however that’s another story for another time :).

Florin Strugariu is a QA engineer and Selenium test developer on a number of different projects. He worked as a maintainer of several test suites for Mozilla’s web pages and Firefox OS automation projects. He is a contributor to Mozilla and several Python plugins used in to develop automated test’s.

Alex Lakatos is a geek building and testing on the open web, trying to push it’s boundaries every day for the past 4 years. You can check out his github profile or get in touch on twitter. When he’s not programming, he likes to travel the world, so it’s likely you’ll bump into him in an airport lounge.
