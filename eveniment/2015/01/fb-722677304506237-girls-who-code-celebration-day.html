<h2>Girls Who Code Celebration Day</h2>
<p class="text-muted">sâmbătă, 24 ianuarie 2015</p>

Girls Who Code Celebration Day is the first Romanian conference that honors the memory of Anita Borg and celebrates women passionate about programming. Anita Borg Birthday Celebration was initiated by the Google Anita Borg Scholars while the event is organized by Girls Who Code - Romania, Girls in Tech - Romania and TechLounge.

Girls Who Code Celebration Day consists in a one-day conference followed by an after-party. The conference will take place at Impact Hub Bucharest, from 10:00 to 18:00, where programmer girls working for companies like Google, Gameloft or Luxoft will share their experience with you. You’ll hear talks about their career paths and the cool projects they have worked on.

The celebration will not be complete without an after-party at the KAFKA Pub, from 20:00 to 23:00, where we’ll continue networking, make funny pics with Cutia cu Poze, and enjoy an improvised show with the actors from Obligó. Boys are welcome!

ANITA BORG 

The event will be held in the memory of Anita Borg, a very talented american programmer who worked on the development of one of the first fault tolerant operating systems. A technology rebel with a cause, Anita Borg is responsible for including women in the technological revolution – not as bystanders, but as active participants and leaders. She is the reason we now have a movement from companies all over the world to increase the number of women in technical fields to a ratio of 50% by the year 2020. Her most important initiatives are: founding the Systers group, the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology and the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference. Anita Borg died in 2003 because of a brain tumor.

THE GOOGLE ANITA BORG MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP

Google offers each year a scholarship in the memory of Anita Borg, for women students who have demonstrated programming and leadership abilities. As such, the alumni scholars from all over the world organize events dedicated to Anita Borg close to her birthday, the 17th of January. The Anita Borg Scholars Community has also initiated this event, which is part of over 100 worldwide similar events.
