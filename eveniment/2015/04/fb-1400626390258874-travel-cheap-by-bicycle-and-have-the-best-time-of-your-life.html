<h2>Travel cheap by bicycle and have the best time of your life!</h2>
<p class="text-muted">marți, 28 aprilie 2015</p>

Ce:
If riding your bike around the city is not enough any more and you begin to wonder about taking a longer trip, this presentation might answer some questions you are probably asking yourself.

Chris and Janina will share their stories about some of their bike trips from the last 2 years. Some short ones around Romania, of 200-300 km, and some longer ones, like 2 months around the Balkans and 2 months in South Africa and Madagascar. 

The workshop will be full of great advices, as well. Janina and Christopher will share lots of practical tips about bicycles and about exploring countries on bicycles. Chris built his bike on his own and had to learn everything about bicycles from scratch.

Cu cine:
Chris is an American linguist and an experienced hitchhiker who one day got tired of hitchhiking and decided in 2013 to do his travelling by bicycle. His wife Janina, from Poland, at first was very skeptical, but now she loves it. Chris took his first trip alone in March 2013 and that same year, in the summer, both of them went on the 2-month Balkan trip. 

Cu ce:
Pen and paper, and lots of questions :)
