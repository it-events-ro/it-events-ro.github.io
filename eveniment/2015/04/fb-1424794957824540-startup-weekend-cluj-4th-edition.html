<h2>Startup Weekend Cluj | 4th edition</h2>
<p class="text-muted">vineri, 24 aprilie 2015</p>

What?
Startup Weekend is a concept that was created in USA and exported all around the world. Its main goals are education and personal development. The organizers provide you the context, resources, mentors, and most important, the opportunity to meet new people that are also eager to create a startup. 

How?
The main idea of the event is very simple: you have 54 hours and the opportunity to start your own business during this time. At the beginning, everyone has the chance to pitch an idea in front of the group, then the participants vote for the best and the most interesting ideas, and the teams are created. The next step is the most exciting: the development of the business idea. The teams must take into consideration everything that is essential for a business: the visual component, the technical one, the way it will work, and also the marketing strategies. On the last day the teams have to prepare their final pitches and the website, the app, the mockups or just a very well organized plan, and present it, in front of the jury. 

When?
Three years ago, Startup Weekend was organized for the first time in Cluj. During the past editions a lot of teams were created, people had the opportunity to learn, to share their experience and to launch their ideas at different incubators such as LaunchHub or Hubraum, and other tech events like: How To Web, Tech Open Air, IT4Change Summit. 
This year the event will take place between 24-26 of April.

Who?
The mentors that are going to be there to help you develop your idea are: Margherita Kramer (Business Development & Strategies at AIT Austrian), Yann Girard (avid entrepreneur, author & speaker), Simon Obstbaum (Owner & General Manager of Yopesso), David Trayford (Managing Director at Wow Media & Founder at TheHub.hu), Salim Virani (founder Leancamp & partner Founder Centric), Mark Tuttle (Co-founder & CEO at Cryptografx Security Solutions), Robbert Visser (Co-Founder & Managing Partner at SquareOne Startups), Bogdan Herea (CEO & Founder, PITECH+PLUS), Emil Tamaș (Co-founder @ Moqups, G¥SHIDO Sensei) 
Make the weekend of 24-26 April count and get your ticket that will bring you to the entrepreneurial ecosystem surrounded by enthusiastic startupers. 

Where?
The event will take place at Exclusiv Catering. The ticket covers 7 meals, snacks, drinks and plenty of coffee, the working space, but most important, it will give you access to the guidance and knowledge of our brilliant mentors. And if you manage to have an excellent project, you could win one of the special prizes that our sponsors have prepared for you.
