<h2>Game Lab Cluj #4 - Game Feel | Why your death animation sucks</h2>
<p class="text-muted">marți, 31 martie 2015</p>

Dear game developers and enthusiasts,

We'll meetup again on March 31. More below:

Game feel, the thing that makes you say "This game feels awesome but I don't know why!". A death animation walk through, from the first lines of code, to asset, animations and sound effects creation up to screen shake, particles, displacement maps, composition and polish. 

See the creation of an awesome interactive experience and the importance of game feel and responsiveness, how to make your game feel and look awesome from scratch. 

If you hate it when you press a button and it's not clear what happened in-game, this is for you!

Our speaker will be Nicolae Berbece (Xelu), a game developer who used to have awesomely long hair that was soft to the touch.

He is currently working on "Move or Die", a fast paced competitive multiplayer game scheduled to be released later this year on Steam. He also produced, designed and created the art for other titles such as "Concerned Joe" , "Kawairun" and a handful of older browser games created across 5+ years of game development.

Growing up with a computer in the house, he got interested in game development by modding titles like counter strike 1.6 and warcraft 3 back in the 2000's, developing a taste for games with innovative mechanics in the process. He worked online with many programmers, artists and musicians from around the world, developing games in both online and local game jams.

Get in touch with him at nick@thoseawesomeguys.com, he'll happily talk about anything related to games, so you're welcome to tell him about your projects!

See you soon!
