In late 2002, Robert abandons the Computer Science Faculty of Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca to start one of the first romanian game development studios and authors the first 100% Romanian commercial PC title.
Currently he attends Economy and International Affairs at Babes Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, works as a business manager and lead designer at exosyphen studios and is a managing partner at Axiom Gaming in Miami/Florida, probably one of the first US based startups to have its entire tech backing from Romania.

Some of his career achievements include but are not limited to:

- authoring the successful Hacker Evolution series of games, a completely innovative genre that has shocked the world when it was the no. 4 best seller on the world’s largest online games publisher (Valve’s STEAM), outselling major AAA rated titles.
- authored exoVirusStop, one the first and best mobile antivirus solutions in the world. (Later sold)
- authored GSM-Tracker, the world’s first cross platform mobile location based social network (Later sold)
- ported the notorious Quake game to a Windows Mobile phone in 2004, showing the entire world for the first time, that mobile phones are capable of running full 3D games.
- designed the concept of mobile widgets in 2005, years ahead of its time, and as a result landed a consulting offer from Yahoo.
- Before apps existed on Apple’s iPhone, he designed a web app that was instantly the no. 1 most used web app, according to Apple’s site.
- Designed several iPhone games out of which, one made it to no. 205 out 150.000 apps at that time.

His most recent project is DailyIndieGame, a website oriented at selling discounted games and bundles, launched over a year ago.

In little over one year, it had a spectacular growth, now delivering aprox. 250.000 game licenses monthly and having served over 1.000.000 gamers. Robert is also currently developing the next Hacker Evolution game and a new immersive fantasy action game oriented at giving the ultimate VR experience.

Join us for an event full of insights and learnings from a great local entrepreneur.

See you there! :)
