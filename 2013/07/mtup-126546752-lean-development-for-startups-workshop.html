   INTRO
   <br/>
   For 50 years we have been told the wrong approach on how to start a business. Long business plans, endless market researches and imaginary financial forecasts have done nothing but waste the resources of young entrepreneurs, who have often neglected the study of the most important aspect: the understanding of Who the customer is and the co-creation of a solution that effectively responds to his needs and challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
   WHO CAN PARTICIPATE
   <br/>
   The event is open to anyone, from students interested in learning about the Lean Start up approach to early stage start-ups, as well as established companies willing to challenge their current model.
   <br/>
   It does not matter in what stage participants are with their project, because regardless of the stage, there are always assumptions to be tested.
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
   WORKSHOP STRUCTURE
   <br/>
   The workshop is divided into 4 parts:
  </p>
  <p>
   1. Concepts of Lean Start-Up (30min): Lean vs traditional strategic planning; value vs waste, Validated Learning, We will go through the definitions of success that matter to startups, how to test key business assumptions, pivoting, uncovering the customers archetype, Value Proposition Canvas, Minimum Viable Product, key performance indicators, the funnel, Split testing, Lean Canvas (Ash Murya), the Business Model Canvas (Alexander Osterwalder).
   <br/>
   The paradigm shift (10min): the importance of communities, co-creating value with customers and supporters, crowd-sourcing, the power of openness.
  </p>
  <p>
   2. Business Modeling (50min): participants are given a 20 questions methodology to structure their business model. The necessary theoretical knowledge is introduced to enable better understanding of each question. Participants will be given 1 minute per question: the goal is to focus on key words. Participants without a project will join an existing project and work together to answer all questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   3. Hypotheses Validation (100 min): participants form groups of 4 people and each individual project is given 10 to 15 minutes to present his business model to the rest of the group. Entrepreneurs will benefit from the other start-ups open feedback to draw the most effective strategy to validate key business assumptions and build their Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Mentors will facilitate the collaborative process guiding the debate towards the creation of solutions which can address the start-ups challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
   4. Elevator’s Pitch (40 min): participants will have 120 seconds to pitch their idea in front of the workshop’s audience.
