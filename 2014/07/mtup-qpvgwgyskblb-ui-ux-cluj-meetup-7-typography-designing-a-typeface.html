  <p>
   Hi there!
  </p>
  <p>
   We're kicking off this month with a new UI/UX meetup and with a subject close to all our hearts and eyes especially. It's a theme we've been long waiting for and it's fascinating because it finds itself so much in the concept and creation area.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next week we're going to discuss
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/2/2/event_382323362.jpeg"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   95% of the information on the web is written language. It is only logical to say that a web designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words: Typography.
  </p>

  <p>
   Daniel Muntean has been a Graphic Designer for more than six years, mostly doing freelance work and trying new job positions from time to time. Since 2013, he’s an UX Designer at Yonder, challenging himself into this curious and exciting field. When designing interfaces gets tedious, he’s in his studio producing Electronic Music or taking photographs of playful shadows.
  </p>
  <p>
   After years of working with Typography,
   <a href="http://www.danielmuntean.com">
    Daniel
   </a>
   has decided to create one himself, and took the opportunity of the BA Diploma at UAD to do so. He is going to share that experience with us, and provide an in-depth view of the process of Designing a Typeface from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also on Tuesday, Inya Şerban and Vlad Pârvu will bring us some examples of typefaces made ​​by them.
